# Challenge 12: Employee Tracker

## Description
The purpose of this application was to create a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The application should contain a user-friendly interface, even for non-developers, to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. The application will present the user with a list of options to view, add, or update employee, department, and role information.
